## Introduction
This is the project I worked on in my current workplace.  I love how robust and vast the dataset is to practice my skills on V look up, Date functions, analysis and visualizations. This project is to analyze the data based on flight of an airline and derive actionable insights in order to answer some critical business problems.

## Skills Demonstrated
Some Excel functions which include V lookup, date functions and visualization.

## Problem statement
-	Number of Flight used by Aircraft A319
-	What is the route with the lowest revenue?
-	What is the most common type of Aircraft?
-	What is the most popular month to fly to Fort Lauderdale?

## Data Sourcing
The dataset was provided by my employer which I  extracted into Microsoft Excel for cleaning, analysis and visualization.

## V-Look up
V-Look up was used to add data from the dimension table to the Facts table.
